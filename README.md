# bootstrap-portfolio

## Description

In this task i created a portfolio, but this time using bootstrap, which helped make coding much quicker because i could take the templates from the bootstrap website and customise it to my vision. i also learned more about components which helped upgrade my portfolio from my previous attempt.
